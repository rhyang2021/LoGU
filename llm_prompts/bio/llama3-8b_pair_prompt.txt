He emerged as a prominent figure in the criminal underworld by forming the Guadalajara cartel in the 1970s. Gallardo's rise to power was marked by his adept maneuvering within the Mexican drug trade, where he quickly became a key player.

Under Gallardo's leadership, the Guadalajara cartel evolved into one of the most powerful and feared drug trafficking organizations in Mexico during the 1980s. This cartel controlled a significant portion of Mexico's cocaine trade and resorted to brutal tactics, including murder, extortion, and bribery, to maintain its dominance. The organization’s operations often involved violent conflicts with other drug traffickers, resulting in bloody battles and a series of assassinations.

One notable conflict involved the Arellano Félix cartel, though it is uncertain who led this rival group. Amidst these tumultuous clashes, Gallardo's brutal strategies ensured his rise through the ranks of Mexico's drug trade.

He was subsequently convicted of drug trafficking and money laundering. Gallardo's legacy endures in Mexico's criminal underworld, and his life has been extensively documented in various books and television shows. The popular Netflix series 'Narcos: Mexico' dramatizes both his ascent and downfall as a drug lord.

However, certain details about Gallardo's early life remain unclear. For instance, it is uncertain when and where he was born or what he was doing throughout the 1960s.

The two organizations clashed over control of the drug trade, leading to a series of bloody battles and assassinations.

In 1989, Gallardo was arrested by Mexican authorities and extradited to the United States, where he was charged with drug trafficking and money laundering. He was convicted and sentenced to 41 years in prison, but was released in 2001 after serving 11 years.

After his release from prison, Gallardo returned to Mexico and attempted to re-establish his drug trafficking empire. However, he was eventually forced to flee the country due to threats from rival drug traffickers and law enforcement.

Gallardo is currently believed to be living in hiding, and his current whereabouts are unknown. Despite his reduced influence, Gallardo remains a significant figure in the Mexican drug trade, and his legacy continues to be felt in the country's criminal underworld.
